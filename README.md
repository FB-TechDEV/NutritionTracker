## 🌱 Inspiration

In regions with unreliable internet or power cuts, many people struggle to consistently manage their diet or health routines. We wanted to build something truly **offline-first**, lightweight, and useful for **nutrition awareness** — especially in underserved areas. Our goal was to help users **track what they eat**, make informed food choices, and maintain healthy habits — with **zero dependency on the internet or accounts**.

---

## 🍽️ What it does

**NutritionTracker (NutriPal)** is a fully **offline meal tracking app** that lets users:

* Log meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks)
* Track calories, protein, carbs, and fat
* View nutrition summaries with simple visual charts
* Use a preloaded food database (stored in JSON)
* Plan meals ahead using a weekly calendar
* Store everything locally with **no login or backend**

It’s mobile-friendly and works directly in the browser or as a **PWA (installable)** app.

---

## 🛠️ How we built it

I (@fb.) built this app using:

* **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
* **LocalStorage** for all user data (so it works offline)
* A custom **JSON nutrition database**
* **Chart.js** for graphical nutrition insights
* Vanilla JS for logic and UI (no libraries or frameworks)

It’s a single-page application with everything optimized for performance, privacy, and portability.

## 🧗 Challenges we ran into

* Designing a meaningful app **without relying on any backend**
* Making it intuitive enough for users who are new to fitness or food tracking
* Building an offline nutrition database from scratch
* Ensuring charts and progress tracking worked without syncing to a server

---

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of

* 100% **backend-free**, privacy-first food tracking app
* A clean, responsive UI that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
* No build system, no dependencies — just **pure code and functionality**
* It can be deployed and shared instantly without any server

---

## 📚 What we learned

* How to build truly offline web apps using LocalStorage and browser-native features
* The importance of usability and accessibility in tools designed for real-world, everyday use
* Lightweight tools can still deliver powerful impact — even without a backend or login system

---

## 🚀 What's next for NutritionTracker

* Add **custom food entries** (user-defined meals or ingredients)
* Introduce **reminders or motivational messages**
* Add **multi-language support** (Arabic & Swahili)
* Enable **offline export/import** so users can move data between devices
* Build a **low-memory Android wrapper** for use on older smartphones
